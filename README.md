# üß© Sudoku Solver Using Image Processing Techniques

A Python-based solution that uses **OpenCV**, **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, and a **Backtracking Algorithm** to solve Sudoku puzzles from raw images.

---

## üß† Introduction

This project aims to automate the process of solving Sudoku puzzles using computer vision and AI. The system reads an image of a Sudoku puzzle, detects the grid, recognizes the digits using a CNN model, solves the puzzle, and displays the solved puzzle alongside the original for easy comparison.

## üöÄ Features

- Extracts Sudoku grid from image using OpenCV.
- Recognizes digits using a custom-trained CNN model.
- Solves Sudoku using a recursive backtracking algorithm.
- Overlays solved numbers onto the original image.
- Displays both unsolved and solved puzzles side-by-side.
